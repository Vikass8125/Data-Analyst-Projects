## Summary

- **Goal**  
  Analyzing and visualizing road accident data to identify critical patterns and provide actionable insights for road safety improvements.

- **Process**  
  1. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, standardized categories, and removed irrelevant data.  
  2. Data Analysis: Aggregated casualties by year, vehicle type, and road conditions.  
  3. Visualization: Created dashboards to showcase trends such as casualties by area type, road surface conditions, and yearly/monthly patterns.

- **Insights**  
  - Most casualties occur on single-carriageways and during daylight conditions.  
  - Urban areas account for the majority of accidents compared to rural areas.  
  - The highest number of casualties were recorded for cars, emphasizing a need for stricter safety regulations for car drivers.
